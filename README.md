# student-housing-sysstem-v2
This is the second update of the code that i original created during my diploma era. this is for my assignment and assignment only. do not change it in any order that would disturb the code. To start testing the login function, you will these account:

Role	    Username	    Password
Student	  student1	    12345
Admin	    admin1	      admin123
Landlord	landlord1	    landlord123

as you all know, this is the second ver. of my my project, i will left a link for the original project i created 11 month ago below with some gdrive link for another project that fuses with a working database:

the difrent between the old student housing system are, the navigation bar, as before i didn't have enough knowledge to use burger navigation bar and it brings me quite hassle till this day. next is the chart.js, the old student housing system didnt use any chart.js not because i cant or i cant, bu t because i didnt even think implementing it before, thus the v2 version improve the dashboard with more visual than old ver. lastly the login system, before anyone can login/register with anything, i mean literally anything, just type in some random things and it still login in you in, now in the v2, you only can login the credential above to login to the website or be given wqaarning notice that wrong passwords/username. i'll tried to fix more regarding the navigation bar but for now, that all i can do. Yeah, you probally right i need to find expert or chatgpt but my conscience doesn't allow me, yet. Well you could say that's my ego speaking.
